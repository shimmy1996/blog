Sadly, unlike Princess Leia, Carrie Fisher could not come back to life.
This is dedicated to Carrie Fisher.

What I hated:
1. Starting out, Poe feels nothing about his fellows dying. "But we blew up a
   Dreadnaught!?" Also the ridiculous conversation btw Poe and Hux makes it
   really hard to take any of the bad guys seriously, including snoke and hux,
   they are
2. Leia using force: unexpected, but okay. No harm and no gain.
3. Why is Luke so OOO? Why would he doubt his own niece if he sees good in his
   father. I'm okay with this looking just at 7&8, but considering 4-6?
   unacceptable.
4. Where did other jedis following kylo go?
5. The burnt jedi classics were in the falcon at the end, wtf luke and yoda?
6. Luke squeezing milk from giant female Wattos?
7. General snoke been stroke down without much explanation. He can force choke
   ppl light years away but can't tell Kylo is fooling him? He could read kylo's
   mind but couldn't stop Kylo from stabbing him? or I guess that's how rules of
   two work now.
8. Why struggle so badly fighting the guards? No point? cut to the next scene already!
9. Yoda summoning lightning!? Welcome to see a more puppet like yoda but talk
   was too cliche. Yoda's lesson: teach her your failures as well. other parts are bad.
10.Maz WTF!? who is this rando master code breaker wearing some stupid flower in a casino
11.Henikein beer guy as DJ, did he die? No point!? Why was he able to
passthrough the shield!?
12.Not too old this time around to start training?(i guess that's not the point)
13.Kylo long controlled by Snoke, how did he escape? why was he still so unsure
14.Hux was never an appropriate enemy
15.Snoke just appears after all these buildup? Nothing special? Force lightning?
although I guess dooku is guilty of the same stuff but hey at least he fought well.
16.Canto Bight casino was pointless, DJ was pointless. Yes I get they are
mimicking the bar scene from new hope, but it's not there.
17.Structurally, the time line is fucked up. We have three lines of narrative
with two different time lines (Rey's one being stretched much forward) and
syncing back together (unless there is some GR bullshit about the rebel fleet's
time passing slower) etc. Finally they merge into a not so epic fight and another
not so epic fight and then another not so epic fight on Crait (red salt version
of hoth).
18.why the hell deliberately kill off Holdo, just have some droid pilot the
ship. "We've used to lose ppl?" you kept 3po for the longest time for god's sake
19.If they are going the route of killing of the concept of jedi, which makes
sense if they never called snoke sith, just practitioners of dark side, why the
hell reviving the concept in Crait fight scene? Otherwise why mentioning Rey has
such potential in the dark side?
20.owl-penguin toy commercials
21.Rey's parentage doesn't really matter anymore since she is so strong with the
force.
22. Outer rim allies? any followup on this? or is this just another one off
   thing?
23.Luke: yeah, that's pretty much nowhere. Says the farm boy from
Tatooine. "Every word you just said was wrong"
24.Wtf is this spark speech. And wtf Leia slaps Poe. The resistance is fucked
for sure.
25.the red guards doesn't make sense
26.no real development in Rey
27.Luke's story told three times in different fashions!?
28.Kylo stroke luke down and yet can't defeat red ninja guards?
29.Luke's reaction about Han was only one line

What I liked:
1. Rey and Kylo(Ben) connecting. Kylo's transition, his wounds by
   Rey. Confrontation of his feelings. Rey said he is a monster yet begs to luke
   that there is good in him. Rain transfer via force connection.
2. The part where Rey and Kylo fighting for Anakin's lightsaber was pretty good,
   besides we finally get closeups on lightsabers!
3. Luke cloaked himself from using the force? can tell from he not owning his
   light saber anymore
4. little boy telling luke's tales and he seems to be using force to get the
   broom? slave? young force user? ring a bell?
5. Kylo didn't pull the trigger, unlike Han
6. Luke saying laser sword.
7. What Luke really see in Rey was puzzling: dark side of the force? How is this
   reconciled? He walked away seeing Rey lost in anger wielding light saber to
   the rock.
8. Luke taught Rey two lessons, where is the third?
9. Luke never read the jedi classics
10.Rose was a likable character, not counting the transition between losing her
sister and engaging new plan following Poe, who effectively killed her sister in
a suicide mission.
11.Solo's dice chains, although now has strange numbers. the real ones were
picked up by kylo ren
12.Luke winking at 3po
13.Hyperspace strike
14.Admiral Akabar

Notable plots
1. Leia and the underground hole. Explanation: curiosity and desire to know her
   parentage are paths to the dark side? maps directly to Cave of Evil/dark
   force cave.
2. Finn kinda knows it was his fault so he wanted to sacrifice himself for the
   rebels. But what was he doing in the casino!?
3. The scene luke passed away, duel sun setting was exactly the same as a new
   hope.
4. fighting for lightsaber btw Kylo and Rey was great
5. Kylo didn't have his own lightsaber. ? didn't he have his lightsaber on the
   belt? at least it was there when he was waken by Hux
6. "Why did you stop me" "I saved you", okay cmon it's star wars
7. R2 playing the original Leia clip.
8. Maybe hinting so many force usages in the film is to emphasize there will be
   more jedi?

:EXPORT_TITLE: My Very Own Avatar Icon Thingy

:END:

I have been using the symbol for the Old Republic from Star Wars as my goto profile picture for quite sometime. In my attempt to maintain a consistent social network profile over multiple websites, I gradually come to realize that profile picture is the most intuitive way to establish a identity (I guess this is also why services like Gravatar would +be so popular+ exist ). In this case, using a picture from [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Old_Republic][Wookiepedia]] that everyone has access to is probably not the brightest idea. Thus, I set out to create my very own avatar icon thingy.

Since I don't consider myself to have even the least amount of artistic talent, I started out spending quite some time in GeoGebra trying to reconstruct the Old Republic symbol in a systematic way. Filling up my screen with circles and measurements is fun and surprisingly addicting, yet after several hours, I only ended up with a confusing hodgepodge of curves.

#+CAPTION: One of my failed GeoGebra attempts.

#+LABEL: fig:my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-01
[[/img/posts/2018/my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-01.png]]

It is obvious at that point that I won't be able to recreate anything nearly as complicated as the Old Republic symbol, so I started stripping out a more abstract version of it.

#+CAPTION: My process of streamlining the logo.

#+LABEL: fig:my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-02
[[/img/posts/2018/my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-02.png]]

I isolated out the "rising star" part of the original logo and discarded the wing-shaped portions to center the star. Instead of a rising star, I went for the impression of a shooting star and it turned out extremely well (in my opinion at least). With delight, I settled on the logo design a few minutes later. I kept the dark red color scheme (though I actually used =#700000= instead of the original =#710100= because I hate dangling ones) and added a gray background (=#707070=) as using white seemed too bright for me.

#+CAPTION: Final design as shown on my Twitter profile.

#+LABEL: fig:my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-03
[[/img/posts/2018/my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-03.png]]

I also played around with several alternative color schemes, i.e. inverted versions. Maybe I will use these as icons for other projects. So far, I have updated all my actively used social network profiles and changed the favicon of this blog. Hopefully this icon would be unique enough for others to recognize me across different social networks.

:EXPORT_TITLE: 自己画头像
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy.zh.md
:END:

我使用星球大战中旧共和国的标志作为头像已经有不短的时间了。不过最近，当我试图统一我所有的“社交网络人格”时，我意识到独特的头像往往是最为直接的在网上认人的方式（这大概就是为何 Gravatar 这类服务 +如此受欢迎+ 会存在）。这么一想，拿 [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Old_Republic][Wookiepedia]] 上的图片直接作为头像不是什么明智的行为。于是我决定：自己画头像！

由于我并不觉得自己有多少艺术细胞，我最初尝试的方法是在 GeoGebra 里用尺规作图复制原来的头像。这种作图方式很是让人上瘾，但遗憾的是：在荒废几个小时后，我得到的只是一堆纠缠不清的曲线。

#+CAPTION: GeoGebra 中的诸多失败作之一。
#+ATTR_LaTeX: scale=0.75
#+LABEL: fig:my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-01
[[/img/posts/2018/my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-01.png]]

事已至此，我开始意识到我是画不出像旧共和国标志的那样复杂的头像的，所以我采取了另外一种策略：从这些失败作中抽取一个更加简练的图样。

#+CAPTION: 我逐渐简化头像的过程。
#+ATTR_LaTeX: scale=0.75
#+LABEL: fig:my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-02
[[/img/posts/2018/my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-02.png]]

我把原图里六芒星升起的部分提取出来，并舍去了碍事的翅膀形部分使得星形能够居中。经过少许修改后更接近流星的图样看起来（至少对我来说）非常赞。在短短几分钟后，我就完成了我的头像设计。我保留了旧头像的暗红的配色（实际用的是 =#700000= 而不是原图的 =710100= ，因为我有个位数字强迫症）并加上了灰色的背景（ =#707070= ，白色背景有点太刺眼了）。

#+CAPTION: 我推特资料上的完成版头像。
#+ATTR_LaTeX: scale=0.75
#+LABEL: fig:my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-03
[[/img/posts/2018/my-very-own-avatar-icon-thingy-03.png]]

我还尝试了其他不同的配色，比如反色版本，以后可能会拿来作为我其他项目的图标。我所有还活跃的社交网站都已经换上了新头像，包括网站图标。这下大家应该可以更容易地在不同网站上认出我了XD。

Each New Year feels incrementally less special (see the relative length argument I wrote in review of 2018), although as an end to the laziness-inducing and overly noisy holiday season, having festival associated with new goals and resolutions is not too bad an idea.

Looking at the number 2020 does give me a bit more excitement as it always felt like such a distant time in the future: I don't even remember any sci-fi works referencing anything in the 2020s, as most of them either stopped at the 2010s or go way beyond to the 3000s. This new decade is stuck in what I call, an expectation limbo. Oh, fun fact from [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020][Wikipedia]], 2020 will also see the beginning of the year of Metal Rat in Chinese calendar - such a punk name for a something rather traditional.

*** 2019 Rewind
I'm glad to announce that everything went according to plan in 2019!

- ☑ Run 400 miles. [555/400]
- ☑ Write 10 blog posts. [14/10]
- ☑ Stop using Gmail/Inbox app. [2/2]
- ☑ Add =rel=me= links to blog.
- ☑ Dive into Rust and Julia. [2/2]
- ☑ Record books, music, and shows I enjoyed.
- ☑ Clean my desktop computer.

With some uncertainties in my life sorted out, I've been following my daily routines a lot better in 2019. I still procrastinate on blog posts from time to time, but at least I'm also publishing ever so more often. Learning Rust and Julia was fun, and I did get some uses out of them in real projects. I also attempted Advent of Code in both languages and got to the day 17 before each day's questions started taking too much time. I thought about finishing all the remaining ones after Christmas, but decided against it - I don't see myself learning more about the languages through these questions and the time could be better spent elsewhere.

I gave the blog a face-lift, writing a new Hugo theme in the process, with [[https://getkiss.org/blog/20191004a][this article]] serving as an inspiration. I find the process of eliminating all the nice-to-haves and bells-and-whistles oddly satisfying: I enjoy having my blog as a lean, mean, killing machine. The website feed has been updated to use ATOM, with each post displayed in its entirety instead of the default broken summary. I started using web feeds for reading blogs after failing miserably at my last attempt to organize my web browser bookmarks and I've enjoyed it so far.

I went to the movies three times this year, for /Dragon Ball Super: Broly/, /Promare/, and /Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker/, and I mostly enjoyed my time in all three occasions: trying to quantify this enjoyment using a rating is probably not doing them justice, as I enjoyed the three for vastly different reasons. Since I visit the theaters so scarcely, the time I spend on airplanes actually account for a large portion of my movie consumption, and /Spider-Man: Into to the Spider-Verse/ was the stand out among those I watched while flying. On Christmas Eve, instead of /Toradora!/, an tradition of mine during college, I rewatched /Scott Pilgrim vs. the World/, which I also first saw on a flight years ago, and it was as geird (Good but in a weird way and weird but in a good way, like, you know, goodd? This is not a real word yet, but who cares? It's year of Metal Rat!) as I remembered.

As someone that have always lived at places that never snow until 2018, snow to me is such a distant concept that I'd consider any movie with snow scenes a Christmas movie. Even after moving to a snowing city mid 2018, I still haven't seen the stereotypical fluffy Christmas snow that almost seem warm to the touch: all I got were piles of dirty water-ice compound on roadsides (oh and they find their way into your shoes too) that reminds me more of fish market than Christmas. Meh, I bet all those snow in the movies are just props, just like the Moon landing.

Back in 2018, I set up a Mastodon instance, and I have since deleted my twitter account, but I never use Mastodon that much. At first I thought it's just that I'm not the microblogging type, but now I beginning think it's all the cognitive overhead of logging in, editing, tagging, and translating that made posting a status update rather daunting for me. I have been microblogging in [[https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][twtxt]] format for the last few months of 2019 and I did rack up a considerable status count (all 110 of them). Being one command away from dumping whatever silly one-liner I have in mind is quite addicting, and revisiting the twtxt file also gives me new post ideas at times. Separating a Twitter-like social media service into read-only (with feed reader), write-only (what I use twtxt for), and interactive (still figuring that one out) parts simply works better for me. My twtxt file will likely replace Mastodon in the footer this year, as keeping a behemoth (just one more pun, please?) of a web app happy and running has not been exactly pleasant for me.

Speaking of deleting accounts, I've setup forwarding from all my Gmail accounts to my self-hosted email and all my devices are Gmail and Inbox (RIP) free now. I'm still not quite ready to completely ditch the Google accounts yet, but I'm getting closer: I've been trying out registrars other than Google Domains, and using Youtube's built-in web feeds instead of relying on subscriptions. I did finally remove my Facebook account though, and the account purge will likely continue.

*** Road to 2020
Since it worked out really well for 2019, I'll continue to match previous year's numbers on blog posts and running. Donuts have been my guilty pleasure late night in 2019 (thanks to Dunkin'), and it's one of the few kinds of food I still willingly consume despite the detrimental effect to my health. Thus, no donuts in 2020, not under my watch!

I do want to set up a proper data backup workflow, following 3-2-1 strategy and all that. As for new languages to learn, Go has been creeping on my radar for a while and with the release of Go modules, it seems like the right time to jump in. There's also C++20 on the horizon.

2020 will also see the release of several Linux phones (Librem 5 and PinePhone), and I'm more than willing to try some of them out and explore ways of escaping the Apple ecosystem. PineTime, on the other hand, might be the perfect replacement for my aging Pebble Time Round.

Out side of technical ones, I haven't read any books in quite a while, at least not those that can be classified as proper literature, and I seek to change that in 2020.

Here's to the end of Skywalker saga, and whatever comes after generation Z!

每个新年给我带来的新鲜感都不断地下降（参见我在回顾2018时提到的一年的相对长度），不过用一个和新的目标与决心绑定的节日来结束过于嘈杂且让人感到慵懒的假日季节并不是一个坏主意。

话说回来，看到2020这个数字会让人不自觉地感到兴奋，因为这在我的印象里总是存在于极为遥远的未来：我甚至不记得任何描绘2020年代的科幻作品。大多数作品不是止于2010年代，就是直接跳到31世纪，使得接下来的十年处于期待值的空白区域。对了，2020年将迎来农历的庚子年，而有趣的是[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020][维基百科]]的英文直译是“金属耗子”——想不到一个传统概念会有这么朋克的名称。

*** 2019回放
2019年的计划进行的非常顺利！

- ☑ 跑400英里。[555/400]
- ☑ 写10篇日志。[14/10]
- ☑ 停止使用Gmail、Inbox应用程序。[2/2]
- ☑ 给博客加上=rel=me=链接。
- ☑ 进一步了解Rust和Julia。[2/2]
- ☑ 记录我中意的书籍，音乐，和影视作品。
- ☑ 清理台式电脑。

在排除了生活中的一些不确定因素后，我在2019年的日常变得更有规律了。我仍然时不时地拖延博客文章，但至少发布日志的频率高了一些。学习Rust和Julia很有趣，而且我也在实际项目中用到了它们。我还尝试了用这两种语言完成Advent of Code并撑到了第17天，到解决问题所需时间太长为止。我曾考虑过圣诞节后完成所有剩余的问题，但我决定不这样做——我认为自己不会通过这些问题增加对这些语言的了解，把时间花在其他地方可能会更好。

受到[[https://getkiss.org/blog/20191004a][本文]]启发，我给博客写了一个新的Hugo主题。我发现一步步消除那些可有可无的装饰的过程奇怪地令人满足：我希望博客带有任何不必要的东西。本站的订阅源已改为使用ATOM，并且完整显示每篇日志，而不是默认的支离破碎的摘要。在上一次尝试整理浏览器书签并遭遇惨败后，我开始使用网站订阅源来阅读其他博客。到目前为止，我很喜欢这一新方式。

我今年去电影院看了三部电影，分别是《龙珠超：布罗利》，《普罗米亚》和《星球大战：天行者崛起》。三次观影都还算愉快：试图用评级来量化这种享受可能并不公平，因为我喜欢每一部电影的原因都不尽相同。由于我很少去电影院看电影，我在飞机上度过的时间贡献了我电影消费的很大一部分。《蜘蛛侠：平行宇宙》是我2019在飞机上看的影片里最好的一部。在圣诞夜，我没有延续大学期间的传统——看《龙与虎》——而是重温了一部我在数年前的一次飞行中看的电影，《歪小子斯科特》。这部电影的确像我记忆中的那样怪趣。

作为一个直到2018年都住在不会下雪的地方的人，雪对我来说是一个如此陌生的概念，以至于我会把任何有下雪场景的电影都视为圣诞节电影。即使在2018年年中搬到一个下雪的城市之后，我仍然没有看到过那种虽然俗套、但蓬松得似乎带有温度的圣诞雪：我所住的地方只有堆积在路边的脏水和脏冰的混合物（而且它们总能找到办法进入你的鞋子）。这更能让我想到鱼市而非圣诞节。我敢打赌，电影中所有的积雪场景都只是道具，就像登月照片一样。嗯，肯定是这样。

在2018年，我设置了一个Mastodon实例，此后我删除了自己的Twitter帐户，但是我并不经常使用Mastodon。起初我觉得我属于不会写微型博客的类型，但是现在我开始认为是登录、编辑、加标签和翻译的认知开销导致了我不怎么热衷于更新状态。在2019年的最后几个月里，我一直在用[[https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][twtxt]]格式发布微型博客，并积累了相当数量的博文（110条）。当发布我脑海里的任何愚蠢的想法都只有一行命令之遥时，写微型博客还是挺让人上瘾的，并且重新访问twtxt文件有时还会给我带来新的日志想法。将一个类似Twitter的社交媒体服务分为只读（订阅源阅读器）、只写（也就是我使用twtxt的目的）和互动（我还没有很好的解决办法）的部分对我来说更加合适。我的twtxt文件今年很可能会取代页脚里的Mastodon链接，因为维持这个重量级网络应用的日常运行对我来说并不是件愉快的事情。

说到删除帐户，我已经将我所有的Gmail帐户设为自动转发到我自己架设的电子邮箱，并且我所有的设备现在都已经没有了Gmail和Inbox（RIP）应用。我还没有做好完全放弃Google帐户的准备，但是我已经比之前更接近了：我在尝试使用除Google Domains以外的其他注册服务商，并使用Youtube内置的订阅源而非依赖订阅频道来获取更新信息。不过我成功删除了我的Facebook帐户。帐户清理还会继续下去。

*** 2020之路
由于这个办法在2019年效果很好，因此我将继续在博客文章和跑步里程上尝试与去年的数字保持一致。甜面包圈常常是我在2019年深夜里罪恶感的来源（都是Dunkin'的错）。甜面包圈是为数不多的几种尽管会给健康带来不利影响但我仍然愿意食用的食物之一，所以我在此宣言：2020年不会有甜面包圈！

我一直都想正式建立起一套遵循3-2-1原则的数据备份流程。至于要学习的新语言，我已经注意Go有一段时间了。随着Go模块的发布，这似乎是一个合适的开始时机。除此之外，还有即将到来的C++20。

2020年会有几种不同的Linux手机（Librem 5和PinePhone）发布。我很乐意尝试它们，以探索离开Apple生态系统的方法。另一方面，PineTime可能是我已逐渐老化的Pebble Time Round的完美替代品。

除了技术性的之外，我已经有一段时间没有阅读任何书籍了，至少没有任何足以被称为文学作品的书籍。我想在2020年改变这种状况。

为天行者系列的终结以及我很好奇会被如何命名的Z世代之后出现的一代干杯！

*** A Link to the Past
Alright, that's enough puns and /The Rise of Skywalker/ jokes from me. As mentioned before, my blog was originally using WordPress and switched to Hugo in 2017-09-01. To be more specific, I actually had two WordPress blogs: one named Pandora (because of /Borderlands 2/, but this is such an cliche name that I'm sure there's a million other imaginary planets using this name) hosted with WordPress.com, and another being Library of Trantor (because of Isaac Asimov's /Foundation/ series) hosted on Bluehost, with the former written in English and latter in Chinese. Since I kept archives of both before taking them down, I was able to revive all those old posts from the grave using [[https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter][this tool]] and some elbow grease. I refrained myself from leaving out any of the old posts, as the main motivation of this effort is really just to be able to easily see and be reminded of my younger self. It's a strange yet familiar experience reading those old writings: I can see parts of me that has changed and parts that are still distinctively shimmy1996.

Handling images is tricky and my old posts made quite liberal uses of them unfortunately: I opted for the simplest way out and just kept the originals without any kind of fancy compression or styling. I still need to figure out a more efficient way to both store and serve those images. Even with Git LFS available, I was reluctant to add over 300 MB of images to my blog repository (so they are currently in untracked-land), and now my blog could definitely benefit from a CDN setup. Perhaps I could also do what Jupyter notebooks do—encode all images in Base64—to get a single HTML file.

For the regular visitors of my blog out there (if there are any), you might notice that the comment section looks different: that's right, the search for the ideal static site commenting system is finally over for me (until it starts again)! Through out the years, I've used WordPress, Duoshuo (now defunct), Disqus, and Isso as my comment systems. Now, my [[https://git.shimmy1996.com/shimmy1996/hugo-hyperskip][Hyperskip]] has superseded them all: taking inspiration from [[https://staticman.net/][Staticman]], I set up Hyperskip to store all the comments in a TOML file, and opted to use email as the submission method, simplifying the setup. Gone are the days of databases, queries, and external scripts, and I get to migrate and version control all the comments (including the ones from the WordPress era) in the same Git repository as my blog too.

*** The Other Old Friend
One week into the New Year and I have already switched color scheme of the website five times, with another dozen sitting in my folder (totally not because of how unsightly these RGB color codes are). Much like how I'm a bit burned-out from [[/en/posts/2019-12-01-fun-with-fonts-on-the-web/][getting fonts right for everything]], I have decided to remove all custom color choices from the website: no more syntax highlighting, fancy buttons, nor dark modes.

As long as there are little knobs that I can toy around with, I always find myself distracted and spending way too much time worrying about the most insignificant choice of words, colors, or spacing (as you can tell by how much of I blog about the blog). The only cure I found is to simply remove the opportunities of making those choices altogether, and stick with the default. This is why I replaced Isso (I spent too much time trying to make it not look so foreign) and tags and categories are now gone, too.

Completely contrast to how the saying normally goes, I hardly ever find myself missing the things I cut away. More often than not, I sympathize with the elephant that finally broke free from the rope, rather than the remorse after losing something cherished. I do occasionally ask myself whether maintaining all those babbling by my past self is just another such rope holding me back that I just haven't realized yet. Well, my response is: a cowboy could always use a lasso on the road.

*** 通向过去的链接
好吧，《天行者崛起》的玩笑就开到这里。如前所述，我的博客最初使用WordPress，并于2017-09-01切换到Hugo。确切地说，我实际上有两个WordPress博客：一个名为Pandora（源自《无主之地2》，但我敢肯定还有无数其他虚构的行星起了这个已经被用滥了的名字）并托管与WordPress.com上；另一个才是托管在Bluehost上的川陀大学图书室（源自艾萨克·阿西莫夫的“基地系列”）。前者使用英文，而后者用中文。由于我在删除之前保留了它们的存档，使用[[https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter][此工具]]稍下工夫就可以恢复那些旧日志。我避免遗漏任何一篇旧文，因为写博客的主要动机就只是为了能够随时看到过去的自我。重读那些日志是一种奇妙而又熟悉的经历：我可以清楚地看出我的某些部分发生了变化，而某些部分仍然是那个shimmy1996。

处理日志的配图比较麻烦，而不幸的是，这些旧日志在插入图片上毫不吝惜：我选择了最简单的处理方式，只保留了原始图片，没有任何压缩或样式设置。我仍然需要一种更有效的方式来存储和提供这些图像。即使有Git LFS可用，我还是不愿意把超过300 MB的图片尽数添加到我的博客Git仓库中（因此它们目前处于无版本控制的状态）。多了这么多图片，部署CDN应该会大大改善访问速度。或许我也可以学学Jupyter笔记本的做法——将所有图像编码为Base64——以将所有内容塞进同一个HTML文件里。

我博客的常客们（如果有的话）可能会注意到评论部分看起来有所不同：是的，我对理想中静态站点评论系统的搜索终于结束了（直到下次开始的时候）！我曾使用WordPress、多说（已关停服务）、Disqus、Isso作为评论系统，而现在取代它们的是我的[[https://git.shimmy1996.com/shimmy1996/hugo-hyperskip][Hyperskip]]：从[[https://staticman.net/][Staticman]]中汲取灵感，Hyperskip将所有评论存储在TOML文件中，并使用电子邮件作为提交方法，以简化设置。我终于摆脱了数据库查询和外部脚本，并且将所有评论（包括WordPress时代的那些）转移到了和博客相同的Git仓库里进行版本控制。

*** 另一位老朋友
新年刚开始一个星期，我已经切换了五次网站的配色，并还有一大堆其他方案堆在我的文件夹里（绝对不是因为RGB色值本身太过丑陋）。就像我对尝试[[/zh/posts/2019-12-01-fun-with-fonts-on-the-web/][让所有字形用上正确的字体]]感到精疲力尽时一样，我已决定从网站上删除所有的自定义颜色：不再显示语法高亮、花哨的按钮和暗色模式。

事实是，只要有可以调整的选项，我总会发现自己分心并花费太多时间担心那些最微不足道的对字体，颜色或间距的调整（只要看看我的日志中有多少是关于这个博客本身的就不难看出）。我发现唯一的解决方法是完全消除做出这些选择的机会，转而使用默认设置。这就是为什么我换掉了Isso（我在试图使它和博客的外观保持一致上花了太多时间），并移除了日志标签和类别。

与俗语所说的完全相反，我并没有发现我对所舍弃的东西感到留恋。大部分时候，我的感受更近似与终于挣脱了那条绳子的大象的感觉，而不是失去了珍爱之物之后的后悔。我偶尔也会问自己，保留这些来自过去的牢骚和胡言乱语是否只是我尚未意识的另一条束缚我的绳子。对于这个问题，我的回答是：牛仔身边总少不了他的套索。

In case you aren't familiar with Chinese mythology or blogosphere, there's an old meme aptly named "Space of Pangu": a typesetting rule of thumb in favor of additional spacing between Chinese characters (but not punctuation marks) and Latin characters or numbers. My variant of the rule also includes additional spacing around any HTML elements like links and emphasis.

Up till now, I've been manually adding spaces in my source files (in Markdown or org), which is admittedly the worst way to do it. Aside from the additional chore, such a typesetting rule should, in my opinion, be implemented in the output/rendering format, not the source. Besides, manually fixing all the old posts I just brought back is not exactly a rewarding task. Unwilling to load additional [[https://github.com/vinta/pangu.js][JavaScript]], I turned to the all-mighty GNU sed. To add Space of Pangu to the final HTML and XML files that Hugo produces (normally in the =./public= directory), I used the following shell script:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #! /usr/bin/env sh
  # For punctuation marks to be recongnized correctly.
  export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
  find . -path "./public/*" \( -name "*.html" -or -name "*.xml" \) -print -exec sed \
       -e 's/\([a-zA-Z0-9]\|<\/[a-z]*>\)\([^[:punct:][:space:]a-zA-Z0-9\s]\)/\1 \2/g' \
       -e 's/\([^[:punct:][:space:][:alnum:]]\)\([a-zA-Z0-9]\|<[a-z]\)/\1 \2/g' \
       -i {} ";"
#+END_SRC

In case you are adamant about adhering to the recommendation by this [[https://www.w3.org/TR/clreq/#mixed_text_composition_in_horizontal_writing_mode][W3C Working Draft]] and wouldn't mind bloating up the resulting web page, using CSS to create the spacing should do the trick:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  find . -path "./public/*" \( -name "*.html" -or -name "*.xml" \) -print -exec sed \
       -e 's/\([a-zA-Z0-9]\|<\/[a-z]*>\)\([^[:punct:][:space:]a-zA-Z0-9\s]\)/\1<span style="margin:0.25ch;"><\/span>\2/g' \
       -e 's/\([^[:punct:][:space:]a-zA-Z0-9]\)\([a-zA-Z0-9]\|<[a-z]\)/\1<span style="margin:0.25ch;"><\/span>\2/g' \
       -i {} ";"
#+END_SRC

If you are another one of those Space of Pangu disciples, just note that there's no need to worry about adding spaces when leaving comments here: thanks to [[https://git.shimmy1996.com/shimmy1996/hugo-hyperskip][Hyperskip]] comments being inserted at Hugo's building stage, they are affected by those scripts as well. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy staring at the blank spaces.

如果你熟悉中国神话或博客众，那么你说不定听说过被半开玩笑地称作“盘古之白”的排版习惯：在中文字符（但不包括标点符号）和拉丁字符或数字之间增加一定间隔。我所实行的这一规则的变体还包括在所有HTML元素（如链接和强调）的周围也加上间隔。

到目前为止，我一直在源文件（Markdown或org格式）中手动添加空格：这无疑是实行这一规则最糟糕的方法。除了要费额外的工夫之外，这类排版规则还应该，在我看来，仅在输出/渲染时应用。更不用说手动调整我刚刚恢复的那一大堆旧日志不是什么吸引人的差事。因为不愿加载额外的[[https://github.com/vinta/pangu.js][JavaScript]]，我转向了万能的GNU sed。为了将盘古之白添加到Hugo生成的HTML和XML文件中（通常在=./public=目录里），我使用了以下shell脚本：

:END:

It was not until a few weeks ago (while watching Level1 News) that I learned about the complete version of the saying "March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb." I knew the first half of the saying from manga series /March Comes in Like a Lion/, but I had no idea the saying was describing the weather in March.

What you have read so far was actually my entire motivation for starting this post, but it has indeed been a rather unusual March. Because of COVID-19, I'm spending time at home "social distancing", or rather, indulging myself in the company of solitude. In preparation for (a.k.a. using as an excuse) extended periods of working from home, I went on an upgrade spree for electronics: I got a second monitor, a monitor stand, and larger hard drives for my NAS. In fact, I've been gradually expanding my arsenal of devices since last Fall, so look out for a potential setup post.

Amazon's Prime Now service has been keeping me fed for two out of the past three years during which I cooked for myself. It's a bit alarming that Amazon of all things has become literally something I can't live without. But until I have my underground bunker and algae farm, I'll have to make do with this symbiotic (or should I say parasitic) relationship. I'm not sure if I really enjoy cooking though, as least most of my efforts devoted to it has been on how to reduce the amount of time I spend in the kitchen. Fortunately I hardly ever get tired of eating the same dishes, so I just kept making the same ones, while gradually optimizing the preparation: I have yogurt and trail mix for breakfast, beef curry with rice for lunch, and pan-fried salmon with rice and stir-fried cabbage for dinner.

The pandemic also puts my running plans on hold: the trail I normally run on has been closed down. I did get plenty of mileages in before social distancing started (4 weeks ahead of schedule in terms of total mileage now), so I should still be on track to hit my 2020 target. Perhaps due to the snow and ice along the way, my running shoes (Mizuno Wave Rider 23) are wearing out faster than before: at 250-mile-mark, I'm already feeling arch discomfort in longer distance runs, while previous iterations of those shoes lasted until around 300 miles. Aside from shoe issues, shin pain also started to creep up as I've been doing longer runs, so this just might be the opportunity I needed to take some rest. I have converted myself to a morning runner as I plan to ultimately sneak a run or two on weekdays. So far I'm enjoying my morning routines, despite a few of snow-stormy days that were extra tough (but fun). Plus, I get to see sunrise instead of its less cheerful sibling.

Reading the news during the outbreak frequently struck me with an unreal feeling: because of both the things that are actually happening and the way news articles covers them in a deliberately divisive facade. To be fair, asking an organization that preys on human attention to report in a plain and down-to-earth way is an oxymoron in itself. It's probably hypocritical for me to pick on the news agencies though, as I am also guilty of deriving excitement from the current situation: the mere thought that what is ordinarily just an apartment is now my personal fortress against an uncured pathogen is enough to keep me up at night.

Should this indeed be the downfall of humanity, at least my blog and Emacs configuration will (assuming Microsoft means it) live on thanks to the [[https://archiveprogram.github.com/][Github Archive Program]]. Before that, be safe, stay at your personal living pods, and prepare for the neon-colored Space-Age algae diet we've all been waiting for.

直到几周前（在看Level1 News时），我才了解到这条谚语的完整版本：“三月像狮子一样来临，像羔羊一样离去。”我是从漫画《3月的狮子》得知前半部分的，但我当时并不知道这句话是在描述三月的天气。

以上其实就是我开始写这篇日志的的全部动机，但今年的三月的确相当不寻常。由于COVID-19，我正在家中“远离社交”，或者说是沉浸在独处的享受中。为了准备长时间在家工作（绝对是借口），我进行了一连串的电子产品升级：我购置了第二台显示器、显示器支架和更大容量的NAS硬盘。实际上，去年秋天以来我一直在逐步扩展我的设备库。也许我该写一篇日志来记录这些。

我开始自己做饭是三年之前，而最近两年亚马逊的Prime Now服务成了我赖以果腹的唯一食材来源。自己的日常起居竟然如此依赖亚马逊的事实是有点令我担忧。但是在我拥有自己的地下基地和蓝藻农场之前，我只能凑合维持这种共生（或者应该说是寄生）关系。不过，我不确定我是否真的喜欢烹饪，至少我花在烹饪上的大部分精力都在如何减少而非增加在厨房里花费的时间。幸运的是，我几乎从不厌倦吃相同的食物，所以我一直做着相同的几道菜肴，并逐步将每一道菜的准备工作优化到最简：我的早餐是酸奶和混合干果，午餐是咖喱牛肉饭，而晚餐则是煎三文鱼配米饭和炒卷心菜。

病毒的肆虐也使我不得不暂时搁置跑步计划：我平时使用的路线已经不向公众开放。所幸在开始居家远离社交之前，我已经超前完成了不少里程（比起预订计划提前了4周），所以我仍然有望实现2020年的目标。也许是由于路上的积雪，我的跑步鞋（美津浓Wave Rider 23）磨损得比以前更快：在累积里程达到250英里时，我已经感觉到跑长距离时足弓不适，而这双鞋以前的版本可以一直撑到300英里左右。除了鞋子问题外，随着我逐步延长的跑步时间，我时有胫骨疼痛的现象，所以我正好趁这个机会休息一阵。为了最终在工作日也能跑步，我转为了晨跑派。到目前为止，尽管有个别风雪交加的日子比较难熬（但其实挺有趣的），我仍喜欢这一决定。另外，能看到更令人振奋的日出而非日落也是个优点。

在病毒爆发期间所读到的新闻经常给我带来一种不真实感：既因为实际发生的事情，也因为新闻那种刻意挑起矛盾的报导方式。好吧，公平地说，要求一个以掠夺人们注意力为食的机构以朴实、不带修饰的方式来报导新闻本身就是一种矛盾。不过话说回来，同样从当前的情况更多地感到兴奋而非不安的我或许没有资格对新闻媒体的做法挑三拣四：仅仅想到这间普通的公寓现在是我抵御尚无治疗方法的病原体的个人要塞就足以让我睡不着觉。

如果这确实是人类覆灭的开始，至少我的博客和Emacs配置将由于[[https://archiveprogram.github.com/][Github存档计划]]继续存在（假设微软没有说一套作一套的话）。在那之前，请保持安全，不要随便离开自己的胶囊生活仓，并做好准备迎接我们一直苦苦等待的荧光色太空时代藻制食品吧。

:EXPORT_TITLE: Static Alternatives to Mastodon and Gitea
:END:

Like how I decided to switch off Wordpress, I think I've had enough running
Mastodon and Gitea.

Keeping up with configuration changes with Gitea had been annoying, whereas with
Mastodon, breakages are common due the mismatching system library versions
(mostly protobuf) in the dependencies. While the latter is not a fault of
Mastodon itself, having to install two package managers (for Ruby and Node.js,
respectively) just to run a program is rather ridiculous to me.

I started hosting both applications in 2018: Mastadon first as a replacement for
Twitter, and Gitea later in reaction to Microsoft's acquisition of
Github. Looking back, they were probably overkill for my needs: my primary use
case for a git server and a micro blog are both very much single-user focused
and write-only, which means these content should be available in read-only form
for my site's visitors, making static pages the perfect replacement for both web
front ends.

Starting with Mastadon, I'm using the [[https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][twtxt]] format to store and serve my micro
blog. The format has existed for some time now, but enjoyed a recent resurgence
in the tildeverse (a series of websites offering public access Unix-like
systems). While there is now a whole community supported ecosystem of various
syntax extensions and software seeking to add more features to the format, I
have found the barebone timestamp-tab-and-then-text syntax to be sufficient. The
write-and-forget cycle is really addicting, and even more so when using a
command line client (mine is aptly named [[https://git.shimmy1996.com/twixter/][twixter]]).

As for Gitea, while an excellent Github replacement in my opinion, is more
suitable for community collaboration than as a personal project dumping
ground. I opted to manage the git repositories directly (see Chapter [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server][4.4]] and [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Git-Daemon][4.5]]
of /Pro Git/), and use [[https://git.codemadness.org/stagit/][stagit]] to generate the corresponding HTML files. These
stagit-generated pages have replaced Gitea as the new [[https://git.shimmy1996.com/][Trantor Holocron]].

Now that I have found satisfactory solution for the write-only portion of my
online presence, I will continue to explore options for the remaining two
pillars: read-only (content consumption) and interaction (means of
communication). Web feeds and email are my best answers now, but they still
don't cover all the bases in my experience.

:EXPORT_TITLE: Mastodon和Gitea的静态替代品
:END:

就像我当时决定换掉Wordpress一样，我觉得我已经受够了运行Mastodon和Gitea。

跟上Gitea设置选项的频繁改变一直很烦人，而使用Mastodon时，由于系统库版本不匹配
（通常是protobuf）造成的依赖软件包出错十分常见。尽管后者不是Mastodon本身的错，但
需要额外安装两个软件包管理器（分别用于Ruby和Node.js）来运行一个程序对我来说是很
荒谬的。

我于2018年开始在服务器上运行两者：先开始的是作为Twitter替代品的Mastadon，而Gitea
则是我后来对微软收购Github的回应。回头想想，相对于我的需求，这有点大材小用：我的
git服务器和微型博客的主要用例都是单用户中心的只写任务。这意味着这些内容应以只读
形式提供给我网站的访问者，而静态网页正是完美的替代品。

从Mastadon开始说起，我现在使用[[https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][twtxt]]格式存储和发布我的微型博客。这一格式已经存在
了一段时间，但最近在波浪号社区（tildeverse，一系列提供可公共访问的类Unix系统的网
站）中开始重新流行。尽管现在有一整个旨在为该格式添加更多功能的社区支持的生态系统
（其中包含各种语法扩展和软件），但我发现最基本的的时间戳加制表键加文字的语法已足
够满足我的需求。这种即写即忘的形式确实很容易上瘾，尤其是与自己写的命令行客户端搭
配使用时（我的版本被恰当地命名为[[https://git.shimmy1996.com/twixter/][twixter]]）。

至于Gitea，虽然我认为是Github的优秀替代品，但它更适合于多用户协作，而不是作为个
人项目的闲置场。我决定直接自己管理git仓库（参阅/Pro Git/的[[https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v2/%25E6%259C%258D%25E5%258A%25A1%25E5%2599%25A8%25E4%25B8%258A%25E7%259A%2584-Git-%25E9%2585%258D%25E7%25BD%25AE%25E6%259C%258D%25E5%258A%25A1%25E5%2599%25A8][4.4]]和[[https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v2/%25E6%259C%258D%25E5%258A%25A1%25E5%2599%25A8%25E4%25B8%258A%25E7%259A%2584-Git-Git-%25E5%25AE%2588%25E6%258A%25A4%25E8%25BF%259B%25E7%25A8%258B][4.5]]章），然后使用
[[https://git.codemadness.org/stagit/][stagit]]生成相应的HTML文件。这些由stagit生成的页面已经替代Gitea作为新生的[[https://git.shimmy1996.com/][川陀全系
档案馆]]。

在解决了我在线存在的只写任务需求后，我将继续探索剩下的两个难题：只读（内容消费）
和交互（通讯方式）类操作。目前，订阅源和电子邮件是我最好的答案，但是它们仍然不足
以涵盖我所有的需求。

我的头像也是自己制作的，不过我不会用图片编辑工具，所以直接用了一个在线服务，拼凑了几个卡通图案，然后用了十几年了。

Ayyyy - it's been quite a while for sure! Glad to see the revival of your site. I consider personal website to be part of my digital identity - not too different from having a twitter account except that I own all the data - so I guess its existence is the whole point (no pun intended)?

I've been using Manjaro exclusively for at least a year(yeah I'm not quite nerd enough to try Arch in its original taste or even Gentoo XD), One thing I love is I can easily invert the color of window with shortcuts. Together with many other pros I can finally say I love linux for its own sake but not out of my hatred for Microsoft. LOL.

How is LaTeX rendering implemented for your blog? Does it work well with dare mode?

Interesting - is that a function of the desktop environment that you use? Does it handle images correctly?

For LaTeX rendering, I'm using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), which is supposedly faster than the more popular MathJax. It respects the html color tags so it works fine in dark mode. I haven't figured out an efficient way to include my LaTeX macros so the only example of posts using LaTeX so far is the LaTeX logo [here](https://www.shimmy1996.com/en/posts/2018-05-21-construction-finished/).

I don't really know I am the guy who introduced you to the Linux wonderland XD. I've been using all sorts of distributions along the way but eventually settled on Manjaro, before I completely ditched Win.
I still do distro/DE/WM jumping sometimes, but I have an inexplicable distaste for VMs so I installed them into SD cards(have to do some chainloading to boot into it but visually more appealing, without an USB dongle ) or USB drives, and they run very smoothly, which is quite unexpected.

For KDE out of the box there's an invert option in desktop effect settings, you can specify different hot key for window inversion or global inversion.
For Cinnamon you can install a extension in it's own extension market that can do the same thing.
For other gnome derivatives, install xcalib and register a hot key to 'xcalib -i -c' can handle global inversion ,still don't know how to do window-wise inversion.
Because it's inversion on the level of window composition so images will also be inverted, it's okay for me though. For webpages there's a firefox plugin that can handle image aware inversion.

Intriguing - I'm running i3/sway on my setup and use system-wide dark mode via `gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme` config. It's finicky in that its effectiveness depends on application support. In context of website dark modes, Firefox picks that setting up and loads the correct CSS but Chromium doesn't.

My primary use case for VMs is to run certain Win/Mac only programs (yes Adobe I'm looking at you and your stupid encrypted PDFs). For distro hopping, VM is nice in that it circumvents most driver issues, but I can see the appeal of SD card/USB drive approaches - much more portable if you want to run on different devices. Modern day flash memory are probably magnitudes faster than HDDs in random reads - good ol' technology!

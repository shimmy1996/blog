After eight months, my blog have finally reached a place where I feel comfortable taking down the "under heavy construction" notice on my home page. In stead of out right deleting the site road map though, I'm stashing it into a blog post.


## Site Road Map {#site-road-map}

-   [X] ~~Find new hosting location.~~ Currently using DigitalOcean.
-   [X] Install Arch Linux on server.
-   [X] ~~Search for WP replacement.~~ Hugo is pretty good.
-   [X] ~~Find a suitable theme.~~ Currently using `hugo-xmin` , may consider forking it and write my own ( `soresu` ).
-   [X] Server side config, like `post-receive` for git auto deploy.
-   [X] Language switcher that does more than redirecting to home page.
-   [X] Enable Disqus.

-   [X] Improve templates for posts to display tags and categories.
-   [X] Cosmetic changes, i.e. no underlines for hyperlinks.
-   [X] Deal with some nuances in using `org-mode` with `hugo` , like how to get syntax highlighting to work properly.
-   [X] Host my own email.
-   [X] Customize `hugo new` to make it more useful, i.e. create multilingual versions directly.
-   [X] Self-host commenting system as a replacement of Disqus.

## What's on Home Page Now? {#what-s-on-home-page-now}

I already have an about page and a contact page for whatever I think people might be interested in knowing about myself, so I have no clue what I should put on home page. Since I found the old site road map to be a great way of reminding myself the stuffs I need to get done, I'll replace the road map with another to-do list: my goals for 2018. I am definitely not the most motivated kind of person, but seeing an unfinished to-do list every once in a while does get on my nerves. Let's see how well this is gonna work.

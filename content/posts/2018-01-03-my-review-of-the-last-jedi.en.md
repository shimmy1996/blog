Sadly, unlike Princess Leia, Carrie Fisher could not come back to life.
This is dedicated to Carrie Fisher.

What I hated:

1.  Starting out, Poe feels nothing about his fellows dying. "But we blew up a
    Dreadnaught!?" Also the ridiculous conversation btw Poe and Hux makes it
    really hard to take any of the bad guys seriously, including snoke and hux,
    they are
2.  Leia using force: unexpected, but okay. No harm and no gain.
3.  Why is Luke so OOO? Why would he doubt his own niece if he sees good in his
    father. I'm okay with this looking just at 7&8, but considering 4-6?
    unacceptable.
4.  Where did other jedis following kylo go?
5.  The burnt jedi classics were in the falcon at the end, wtf luke and yoda?
6.  Luke squeezing milk from giant female Wattos?
7.  General snoke been stroke down without much explanation. He can force choke
    ppl light years away but can't tell Kylo is fooling him? He could read kylo's
    mind but couldn't stop Kylo from stabbing him? or I guess that's how rules of
    two work now.
8.  Why struggle so badly fighting the guards? No point? cut to the next scene already!
9.  Yoda summoning lightning!? Welcome to see a more puppet like yoda but talk
    was too cliche. Yoda's lesson: teach her your failures as well. other parts are bad.

10.Maz WTF!? who is this rando master code breaker wearing some stupid flower in a casino
11.Henikein beer guy as DJ, did he die? No point!? Why was he able to
passthrough the shield!?
12.Not too old this time around to start training?(i guess that's not the point)
13.Kylo long controlled by Snoke, how did he escape? why was he still so unsure
14.Hux was never an appropriate enemy
15.Snoke just appears after all these buildup? Nothing special? Force lightning?
although I guess dooku is guilty of the same stuff but hey at least he fought well.
16.Canto Bight casino was pointless, DJ was pointless. Yes I get they are
mimicking the bar scene from new hope, but it's not there.
17.Structurally, the time line is fucked up. We have three lines of narrative
with two different time lines (Rey's one being stretched much forward) and
syncing back together (unless there is some GR bullshit about the rebel fleet's
time passing slower) etc. Finally they merge into a not so epic fight and another
not so epic fight and then another not so epic fight on Crait (red salt version
of hoth).
18.why the hell deliberately kill off Holdo, just have some droid pilot the
ship. "We've used to lose ppl?" you kept 3po for the longest time for god's sake
19.If they are going the route of killing of the concept of jedi, which makes
sense if they never called snoke sith, just practitioners of dark side, why the
hell reviving the concept in Crait fight scene? Otherwise why mentioning Rey has
such potential in the dark side?
20.owl-penguin toy commercials
21.Rey's parentage doesn't really matter anymore since she is so strong with the
force.

1.  Outer rim allies? any followup on this? or is this just another one off
    thing?

23.Luke: yeah, that's pretty much nowhere. Says the farm boy from
Tatooine. "Every word you just said was wrong"
24.Wtf is this spark speech. And wtf Leia slaps Poe. The resistance is fucked
for sure.
25.the red guards doesn't make sense
26.no real development in Rey
27.Luke's story told three times in different fashions!?
28.Kylo stroke luke down and yet can't defeat red ninja guards?
29.Luke's reaction about Han was only one line

What I liked:

1.  Rey and Kylo(Ben) connecting. Kylo's transition, his wounds by
    Rey. Confrontation of his feelings. Rey said he is a monster yet begs to luke
    that there is good in him. Rain transfer via force connection.
2.  The part where Rey and Kylo fighting for Anakin's lightsaber was pretty good,
    besides we finally get closeups on lightsabers!
3.  Luke cloaked himself from using the force? can tell from he not owning his
    light saber anymore
4.  little boy telling luke's tales and he seems to be using force to get the
    broom? slave? young force user? ring a bell?
5.  Kylo didn't pull the trigger, unlike Han
6.  Luke saying laser sword.
7.  What Luke really see in Rey was puzzling: dark side of the force? How is this
    reconciled? He walked away seeing Rey lost in anger wielding light saber to
    the rock.
8.  Luke taught Rey two lessons, where is the third?
9.  Luke never read the jedi classics

10.Rose was a likable character, not counting the transition between losing her
sister and engaging new plan following Poe, who effectively killed her sister in
a suicide mission.
11.Solo's dice chains, although now has strange numbers. the real ones were
picked up by kylo ren
12.Luke winking at 3po
13.Hyperspace strike
14.Admiral Akabar

Notable plots

1.  Leia and the underground hole. Explanation: curiosity and desire to know her
    parentage are paths to the dark side? maps directly to Cave of Evil/dark
    force cave.
2.  Finn kinda knows it was his fault so he wanted to sacrifice himself for the
    rebels. But what was he doing in the casino!?
3.  The scene luke passed away, duel sun setting was exactly the same as a new
    hope.
4.  fighting for lightsaber btw Kylo and Rey was great
5.  Kylo didn't have his own lightsaber. ? didn't he have his lightsaber on the
    belt? at least it was there when he was waken by Hux
6.  "Why did you stop me" "I saved you", okay cmon it's star wars
7.  R2 playing the original Leia clip.
8.  Maybe hinting so many force usages in the film is to emphasize there will be
    more jedi?

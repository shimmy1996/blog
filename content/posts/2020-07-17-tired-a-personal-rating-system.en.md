As the pandemic gives me a change to look through my backlog of movies, shows, and books (read: anime and manga), I started to consider establishing a personal rating system to ease up writing (hypothetical) reviews.


## Guiding Principles {#guiding-principles}

Typical rating scales feature 10 or more levels, which is in my opinion way too wide a range to choose from, not to mention those featuring a 100-point-scales. Even the most common 5-star system gets cumbersome fast as soon as we take half-stars into consideration. What exactly differentiates a 6 from a 7 or a 4.6 from a 5.1? Higher granularity could be useful in aggregated ratings, but not so much from an individual reviewer's perspective. I much prefer the approach [s1vote](http://s1vote.com/) took: give the users fewer but more distinctive levels to pick from.

My anecdotal evidences show that most online ratings converge around the 70% mark, a rating just as safe and useless as [predicting a 40% success rate for anything](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/06/29/this-one-quick-trick-will-allow-you-to-become-a-star-forecaster/). In other words, the lower half of most rating scales are underutilized: how often would you rate something one-and-a-half-star instead of just one? Besides, more often than not, I read ratings and reviews to find out about good shows, not the bad ones. It should be sufficient to only focus on "the better half": why would I sit through the entirety of a bad show and take the effort to give it a rating anyways? Think there is no half-star in Michelin.

Summarizing the quality of anything with a single metric seems unfair. I want the rating system to be more expressive, capable of conveying the different aspects of a show that I find enjoyable. At the very minimum, an opinionated pick should be distinct from something with a more general appeal.


## Rating Methodology {#rating-methodology}

Enter the TIReD scale! The following uses anime/tv shows as the example here, but much of this methodology also applies to other art forms. A show is scored in the following categories, with sum of points forming the final rating:

| Category                         | Range |
|----------------------------------|-------|
| <strong>T</strong>angible        | 0-2   |
| <strong>I</strong>ntangible      | 0-2   |
| <strong>Re</strong>visit-ability | 0-1   |
| <strong>D</strong>iscretionary   | 0-1   |

Tangible aspects of a show include visual style, animation, soundtrack, CG quality, special effect, etc. To put it simply, how physically well-made a show is. Starting from a score of 0, a show would be scored a

-   +1 if the show is overall attractive to watch and either has very few shortcoming (perfection) or utilizes unique ideas/techniques to great effects (genius);
-   +2 if its physical quality/way of expression alone would be sufficient reason to watch the show, even if it gets a 0 in all other categories.

Intangible aspects include story, character building, plot pacing, popular culture reference, etc. This quality should be relatively medium independent, i.e. I would enjoy a faithful recreation of the story in other art forms at least just as much. Criteria for scoring is similar except for remakes/adaptations with an clear intent to follow the original and when I have seen/read the source material: scoring would be based on the source material's intangible score adjusted downwards by 1 point, with at most extra 1 point adjustment based on quality/difficulty/effect of the remake/adaptation with in the range of 0-2. For instance, a mediocre retelling of a +2 story should only be awarded at most a +1. Remakes and adaptations probably have an easier starting point than original contents, so I wanted to adjust for "how good the show could have been", provide an answer to "should I still see this if I've seen the original", and pick out the "watch this instead of the original" shows.

Revisit-ability, as the name indicates, represents whether I would want to revisit/rewatch the show later. This correlates more with my own taste or nostalgia. Think cult classics but with a one-person following. However, in event of remakes and adaptations, this point should generally only be rewarded to the best version of the work in my point of view.

Discretionary point should be awarded sparingly and only when a show doesn't already achieve full scores in all other categories, making the possible maximum score 5 instead of 6. This is used as an adjustment for shows that I feel the current rating system doesn't do it justice. Common situations where this applies include but are not limited to:

-   categorical superiority: best of its kind;
-   quality in spite of subjective limitations, especially for older shows or those with a tight budget.


## Format {#format}

A TIReD rating is recorded as `X=T/I/Re[+D]`. For instance:

-   a show scoring 1 in tangible, 2 in intangible, 0 in revisit-ability, and 0 in discretionary would be recorded as `3=1/2/0`;
-   a show scoring 1 in tangible, 0 in intangible, 0 in revisit-ability, and 1 in discretionary would be recorded as `2=1/0/0+1`.


## Self Q&A {#self-q-and-a}

Some fragments of thoughts that I came across when designing TIReD.

**Q:** How should tangible points for books be awarded?

**A:** I'd say it's how good the writing is at face value, i.e. is it "literature" worthy. While I not really confident in my ability of identifying great works, but at least something like _Harry Potter_ is not +2 material for sure.

**Q:** How should world settings built up in previous/related works affect the rating?

**A:** World building actually fits into both revisit-ability (if the system/world is interesting and makes me want to read more about it) and intangible quality (whether the characters are memorable).

**Q:** Should discretionary point be awarded only to works that achieve full mark in at least one of the first three categories?

**A:** Probably not, some seemingly not-so-impressive works really show the passion/devotion/love/good faith of the production team. There are shows whose existence alone is a boon for its fans. Just elaborate the reason, no need to pick a specific category for this extra point.

**Q**: How did you come up with the name "TIReD" (and name for the categories)?

**A**: The first category to have a concrete name is revisit-ability. From there on it's mostly just playing around with words and initials. I almost settled on "TIRD", but ended up deciding against it thanks to [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tird). Besides, not everything is sh\*t. ðŸ˜œ

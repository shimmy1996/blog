MS Edge has surpassed Firefox as the second most popular web browser. What a gloomy timeline we are in...Probably not the most appropriate analogy, but I think monoculture is inherently harmful in both biological sense and web browser market: it is already bad enough that we have to disable all kinds of things in a web browser just to stop some of the malicious tracking, I really don't want the largest advertiser on Earth also being the maker of all web browsers.

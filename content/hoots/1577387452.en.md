Just finished S2, and I think Sympogear is just the kind of show that doesn't even need a good story to stand out - it's like an amalgam of macross, precure, kaiju, and many other awesome pieces without feeling out of place. The bond between characters that audiences deeply invest in and the amazing choreography/music are so strong that it easily powers through the arguably somewhat messy story line and just make it an enjoyable show to watch.

In someways I think the Rise of Skywalker is the example of what a less successful such attempt would look like: also a messy and overstuffed story, but TROS' other aspects are just not strong enough to overcome this and be remembered as a great emotional experience, instead, it will forever be the not-too-bad-not-too-good nonchalant attempt of an ending to a badly planned Star Wars trilogy that probably should never have existed in the first place.

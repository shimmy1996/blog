TIL everytime a Blu-ray drive reads a disc, it updates its Media Key Block (MKB) if it sees a newer version stored on the disc, and that's how my Ultraman Blu-ray essentially bricked my drive (until MKB v70's processing keys and host key/certificate becomes publicly availabe). See how unwanted and forced updates are harmful? I really hope not all media formats are designed with DRM in mind primarily, but it seems that CDs are more the exception than the norm.

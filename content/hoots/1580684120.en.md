Similar thing with images...I still have an irrational attachment to the "original" images, including photos I took myself and album covers, even though they are most certainly different from what I actually see and are not even RAW files. This is why I avoided taking photos and preferred recording everything in text, the one thing we actually know how to store lossessly.

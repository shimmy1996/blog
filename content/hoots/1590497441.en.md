A sunny day today. I found out in unease that the four spider webs out of my windows each have its own owner by the coin-sized shadows they cast on my curtain. While yesterday I was still able to fantasize about spider simulation games where you need to tend to multiple webs and process the caught insects before they overstrain the web, now all I could think about is how to prevent them from over populating.

Apr 14th: 9 miles in 01:15.

After consciously increaseing my cadance for a few runs, I finally noticed source of the outer calf pain: I was overstriding and thus bending my ankles a lot more often than necessary. Once I figured that out, the run become quite a lot easier. This is the best time I have ever got on a 9 miler!

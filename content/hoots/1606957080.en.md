It's exciting to see another website supporting WebMention (and return of the CSS snow)!

My primary motif of using WebMention is to ultimately centralize all my comments/replies/posts on blogs/forums/Fediverse back to my website (and allowing commenters on my site to do the same). This subsequently prompted me to add a short note/title-less post section here.

Do you plan on displaying contents of the WebMentions you get or sending WebMentions from your website?

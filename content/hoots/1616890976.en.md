Never thought I'd see some of the most unique software/hardware user interfaces in musical instruments. It does makes sense in that forcing sounds out of what is frequently a digital device beneth the cover using our fleshy human fingers is such a niche combination in itself (compared to what computers are first designed for) that there is simply no "general" way to do it, allowing for tons of experimentation and specialization.

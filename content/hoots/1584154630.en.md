Tried to set up Syncthing for music - actually the primary reason I went with an Android based player - but was disappointed to find out Syncthing doesn't support SD card storage. Setting SD card as internal storage is a workaround, but the Android version on the player is missing the 'format as internal' option. Bummer :(

A while back I read a statement claiming that scientific calculators are some of the slowest evolving pieces of tech, and I tend to agree. Although I have used some of the newer calculators with half-baked CASs, they just felt clunky and unresponsive like any electronics in the early 2000s. Wouldn't it be amazing to just have a portable Mathematica terminal?

ATH SR9 gives my a lot of sibilance at first - also tried MSR7 and it was even worse, to the degree of not listenable - with burn in and a bit of EQ tweak it gives a really detailed sound. It also feels brighter than ATH CKR100. Female vocals sound irresistible on SR9, but otherwise I do like CRK100 a bit more now.

Lunch on the day of workplace satisfaction survey felt particularly delicious: flat iron steak laced with just the right amount of fat and smashed potatos baked to perfection. Yum! Even the box of fruit had the half-translucent-almost-jello-like kind of sweet melon - the kind you would see Suneo enjoying in a hot Summer afternoon, fresh out of the fridge.

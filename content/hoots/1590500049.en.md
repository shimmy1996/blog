After sitting through an unconfortable amount of spider GIFs and pictures, I think the spiders living out of my window are Bridge Orb-weavers (Larinioides sclopetarius), a not-too-distant relative to the onein /Charlotte's Web/. I bet the story would have a rather different vibe if there were a swarm of spiders instead of just one.

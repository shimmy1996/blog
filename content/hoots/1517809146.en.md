Feb 4th's run: 3 miles in 00:36. Starting the run a lot earlier today at 2:30pm. I suspect my left foot is displaying a slight sign of plantar fasciitis. Perhaps it's caused by me running only in the same direction (ccw)? The pain has relieved quite a lot compared to a few days ago fortunately.  Next week is gonna be cold, so I'll just rest and wait for the pain to further relieve.

Just realized I have been using up-scaled medium weighted fonts as bold on my website, and the result is actually ok on Firefox, but abysmal on Safari. I replaced all of them with proper bold fonts, but I still couldn't get over how confusing it is to make 400 regular and 500 medium: what should the true mid-point, 450, be called then?

The weather is so great today - blue sky, sunshine, and all that. Made for a very comfortable run. Yesterday on the other hand was horrible: overcast, with short bursts of snow storm hitting every few minutes like thousands of tiny cannon balls, producing metallic noises as they smash on to my glasses and face. There were a few time I could hardly see what is in front of me and felt I was pushing through the snow and wind. I guess Bad Company could be a really scary stand. Fubuki is really the better word than snow storm to describe the situation. Fortunately weather clears up a bit as the day breaks. I was surprised to find myself rather dry after the run though - probably won't be the case if it were a summer storm.

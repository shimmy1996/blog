Jan. 28th's run: 13 miles in 2:02. Great weather, gets a bit chilly after sun set. Running at 58°F/18°C with direct sunlight isn't as sweaty as I expected. Previously I always finish the run without drinking nor eating. This time, however, I tried some random sports drink at the 9th mile and apparently a taste of sweetness when humans are exhausted turns them into super saiyans for a few minutes.

I've been using Radicale instead of iCould on my iDevices as well - I can confirm that the collection URL setup worked for both contacts and calendars.

Creating repeating events on Radicale calendar is one of the things that I have varying degrees of success depending on the client I use: it works fine on iOS, but rather finicky in evolution seemingly due to part of CalDav spec being unimplemented.

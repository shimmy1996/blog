DRM removal tools exist for both Rakuten Kobo and Amazon Kindle. Kobo uses standard EPUB though, instead of the proprietary AWZ like Amazon, which generally works better with readers I have. It is also said that image compression is more aggresive on Kindle books, so Kobo seems to be the way to go - book selection seems pretty on par as well.

Second recovery run - I've largely adapted to wearing respirator masks while running - the only annoying thing is as I sweat, the mask tend to slip and put a lot of weight on my nose, essentially blocking it. It's almost comical seeing how the please wear a mask signs are even less effective than the no alcohol beyond this point ones.

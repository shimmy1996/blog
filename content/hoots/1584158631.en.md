Battery life is not stellar - but something I can get used to - I got to 50% after 8-10 hrs of listening to a mix of flac/hires flac/aac. I mean - back in the day we didn't have to charge our phones for weeks, but look at us now. It does finish charging within 2 hrs or so with a fast charger which is nice.

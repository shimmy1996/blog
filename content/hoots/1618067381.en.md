Using 2 curved 49-inch ultrawide monitors felt great. They are a bit taller than I initially expected and I position them column-wise with the upper monitor tilted downwards. I kinda wish they were curved a bit more, but then the upper monitor would have its corners cut off by the lower monitor. It does feel pretty good to be able to sit as upstraight as I can and still be able to see everything.

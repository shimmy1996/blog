Went to see /Weathering with You/ today and I find myself enjoying it more than I would like to admit: most supporting characters are more interesting than those from /Your Name/, but the Hodaka felt a bit plain/boring, being the almost stereotypical yasashii protagonist as he was. I bet Shinkai is a miko fetish. Natsumi and Nagi are the best girls(?).

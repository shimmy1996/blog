I finally pulled the trigger on Suunto 9 during the sale a few weeks back. It took a while to arrive and was actually lighter than what I expected when comparing the specs against my Pebble Time Round. With news about the Garmin hack going on, can't say that I didn't feel smug about my choice. One thing I worried about Garmin (Suunto 7 as well), is that they are too smartwatch-like. No, not the Pebble-era of smartwatch-ness, but the Apple-Watch-era of smartwatch-ness, a.k.a. the bad kind that strangles you in an eco system. What I wanted was a dedicated device that is the running equivalent of a bike computer and I think Suunto 9 fits the bill better than most other choices. Pebble will remain my choice for daily routines and notifications. I still haven't logged any runs on the watch due to COVID though, but I did tracked the past few days of sleep on it - doesn't sleeping also count as a sport though?

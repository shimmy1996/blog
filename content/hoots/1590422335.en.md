The spider living outside my windows has gradually expanded its web to cover more than half of the openinings. Seeing the number of insects caught on the webs already though, I decided against disturbing it, for now. Gotta watch out for egg sacs though as the thought of potentially thousands of half-translucent eight-leggers crawing past the window sil into the room would be a bit too much for me to handle.

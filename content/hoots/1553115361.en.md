I've started using security keys in conjunction with OTP for 2FA. However,  it really frustrates me that a number of websites only fully support security key under Chrome, namely Google (registering new keys only work in Chrome, but Firefox is making a fix), and now Github ("We recommend updating to the latest Google Chrome to start using security key devices"). Considering MS's Edge rebuild and Skype refresh, I guess that's why we can't have nice things.

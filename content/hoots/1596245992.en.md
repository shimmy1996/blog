Took a detour on the way home today for an hour-long ride on my bike. I was able to cover so much more ground (quite literally) than if I were to spend the same time running. I finally know what's lies beyond my normal running route now. Judging by the fact that most pain is coming from my neck instead of my legs now, I guess I've grew more used to riding.

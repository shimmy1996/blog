Webmentions, check! I'm currently using webmention.io (yes, you heard right, external services) and have no systematic way of handling the thousands of webmentions that is bound to come with this site's inevitable rise in popularityâ€¦not! Maybe a webmention endpoint driven by a simple WSGI script that converts webmentions into emails is just what I need to integrate this into my existing commenting workflow.

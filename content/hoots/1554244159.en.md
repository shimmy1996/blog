Looks like Google Inbox's web front end is still alive as of April 2nd! I've switched away from the Inbox app on my phone, and set up forwarding on Gmail so that I can use the stock iOS Mail app. However, I still much prefer Inbox's web front end to that of Gmail. Let's see how much longer it will last.

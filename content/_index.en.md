# Trantor Library

## _The Plan needs to go on._

```
       5 ./layouts/404.html
      18 ./layouts/_default/list.html
      12 ./layouts/_default/single.html
      16 ./layouts/_default/terms.html
       0 ./layouts/partials/foot_custom.html
       9 ./layouts/partials/footer.html
       0 ./layouts/partials/head_custom.html
      20 ./layouts/partials/header.html
       7 ./static/css/fonts.css
      50 ./static/css/style.css

```

I can certainly further reduce the code, for example, by eliminating the CSS, but I believe a tiny bit CSS can greatly improve readability. You cannot really find many CSS frameworks that only contain 50 lines of code.

Although it is a minimal theme, it is actually fully functional. It supports pages (including the home page), blog posts, a navigation menu, categories, tags, and RSS. With [a little bit customization](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/blob/master/exampleSite/layouts/partials/foot_custom.html), it can easily support LaTeX math expressions, e.g.,

`$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$`

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/). See the [About](/about/) page for the usage of this theme.
